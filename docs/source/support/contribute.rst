==========

There are multiple ways you can contribute to Peppi.

You can contribute by extending the Peppi library yourself and submit a `Pull Request <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/peppi/pulls>`_.

You can also report a `bug <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/peppi/issues/new?template=bug_report.md>`_ or request a `new feature <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/peppi/issues/new?template=feature_request.md>`_

We also recommend that you share your `discussions <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/peppi/discussions>`_ on how you use or would like to use Peppi.

At last, if you have a Jupyter notebook using Planetary Data System (PDS) archive through Peppi, you can submit it with a Pull Request on our dedicated `search-api-notebook repository <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/search-api-notebook>`_.

For information on how to contribute to NASA-PDS code bases please take a look at our `Contributing Guidelines <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
